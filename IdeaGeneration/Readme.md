Ideas
**IDEA 1 : Mystery Quotation**
This activity lets you see how well your students can apply their understanding of an issue or theoretical position. After you’ve explored a topic, show them a quotation and their task is to figure out the point of view behind the quotation and explain it. Make sure remote students have equal opportunity to take part.


**IDEA 2 : Video Reflections**
Using video in the classroom takes advantage of a communication style. You can also have students record themselves as they give a presentation or practice a skill, and then reflect on what they see.


**IDEA 3 : Case Studies**
Case studies have long been a collaborative way to get students to take a deeper dive into issues, plus show real-world applications of course content, they can work well in a hybrid learning class as in a traditional one.


**IDEA 4 : Backchannel Feedback**
When students are listening to a lecture or a classmate’s presentation, have them share their real-time reactions and questions in the chat feature of software. It’s kind of like live tweeting an event. This helps remote students stay fully tuned into what’s going on in class.


**IDEA 5 : Classroom Debates**
Debating is a time-tested way to get students to state positions, formulate arguments and reach conclusions, plus explore an issue from multiple points of view. You can divide the class in two, assigning sides of an issue, with you as the judge. Or have some students take on debating roles while others judge and then switch.


**IDEA 6 : Icebreaker Questions**
When all else fails, it’s handy to have icebreaker questions at the ready. Either to kick off a class or switch things up midstream if energy is lagging. Teacher always must has a good list that ranges from silly to thoughtful. 


**IDEA 7 : Real Time Interaction**
Sometimes, getting all students on the same video call isn’t practical. But, tools like Google Chat, Microsoft Teams and others allow for real-time conversation and collaboration without requiring a video/audio set up.

**IDEA 8 : Make Clear Plans**
Sharing lesson plans or agendas with students in advance came up again and again. This transparency can help ease students’ minds and help them acclimate to the complicated arrangement of hybrid classroom.


**IDEA 9 : Share Daily Plan**
By using a chat tool or sharing your screen, make sure to begin class with an explicit overview of the plan, ensuring that both remote and in-person learners can see it and ask questions. Use simple visuals to clarify tasks to students and drops the relevant image into the chat as different activities take place.


**IDEA 10 : Make Time for Remote Students**
However hard teachers try to involve them in class activities, remote students will require specific attention and care. Setting aside time to build these relationships is critical.
